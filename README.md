**Brand:** Money Atlas / Alternative Slowbar  
**Type:** Custom Skill (SKILL.md format)

## What This Is

A skill that transforms financial market questions into structured, scenario-based intelligence.

Not a prediction engine.  
Not a signal bot.  
A thinking system — built to reason the way a disciplined analyst does.

When you ask about BTC, gold, macro, forex, or any asset — this skill activates a multi-layer reasoning pipeline that separates what's actually happening from what the market narrative wants you to believe.

---

## Core Engine

### Genesis Protocol — 3-Step Thinking Pipeline

**Step 1: First Principle Codex**
Deconstruct the market from root causes — not price action alone.
- What is *actually* happening?
- Why is price/macro moving this way?
- What is the structural driver?
- Where is the asymmetric opportunity?
- What happens next under each scenario?

**Step 2: System Thinking — Micro → Macro**
- Micro: Asset-specific technicals, on-chain data, positioning
- Meso: Sector rotation, correlated assets, sentiment
- Macro: Fed, DXY, liquidity cycle, geopolitics
- Meta: What narrative is the market constructing — and who benefits?

**Step 3: AI Fluency 4D**
- Delegation — Pattern recognition across data
- Description — Convert market noise → structured signal
- Discernment — Question bias, timeframe, missing information
- Diligence — Human makes the final decision. Always.

### SMC Layer — Smart Money Cycle Map

Identifies where price is in the institutional cycle:

| Layer | Phase | What's Happening |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Accumulation | Quiet buying, engineered fake breakdowns |
| L2 | Expansion | Breakout, momentum building |
| L3 | Decision Zone | High-stakes inflection point |
| L4 | Distribution | Quiet selling, engineered fake breakouts |
| L5 | Exit Liquidity | Retail buys tops, institutions exit |

Every analysis maps the current layer + next probable move + invalidation condition.

## Output Modes

### LIGHT MODE — Quick Insight
For single-asset questions and fast reads.

```
📍 MARKET STRUCTURE INSIGHT
[SMC layer + price context]

📍 KEY RISK
[What breaks the thesis]

📍 STRATEGIC TAKEAWAY
[1-2 sentence actionable insight]
```

### FULL MODE — Deep Analysis
For investment decisions, macro analysis, strategy, or "should I" questions.

```
📍 SITUATION MAP
📍 FIRST PRINCIPLE BREAKDOWN
📍 SYSTEM MAP (Macro → Liquidity → Asset → Price)
📍 SMC LAYER MAP
📍 NARRATIVE INTELLIGENCE
📍 SCENARIOS
   🐂 Bull: [entry zone | target | condition]
   🐻 Bear: [trigger | target | condition]
   ⚖️ Base: [most probable path]
📍 DECISION FRAMEWORK
📍 RISK & FAILURE MODE
   CONFIDENCE: [X%] | KEY UNKNOWNS: [list]
```

Mode is auto-detected from question context.  
User can override: type `FULL` or `LIGHT` at any time.

## Trigger Topics

This skill activates when you ask about:

- **Crypto:** BTC, ETH, altcoins, on-chain data
- **Commodities:** Gold, silver, oil, soft commodities
- **Macro:** Fed policy, interest rates, inflation, DXY, liquidity cycles
- **Equities:** Stocks, indices, sector rotation
- **Forex:** Currency pairs, emerging markets
- **Geopolitics:** Events affecting market structure
- **Strategy:** Portfolio allocation, risk management, entry/exit frameworks

---

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Give single-point price predictions without scenarios
- Express certainty without evidence
- Omit the risk or invalidation condition
- Tell you what to do — it gives you a framework to decide

If output violates any of these → the system flags `⚠️ INSUFFICIENT EDGE` and re-evaluates before responding.

## How to Install (Claude Custom Skill)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Place the `money-atlas-intelligence-os/` folder in your Claude skills directory
3. The skill activates automatically when Claude detects relevant financial market questions
4. Or call it explicitly by referencing the skill name in your system prompt

---

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

Every output must include:

- **Multiple scenarios** — no single prediction
- **Explicit uncertainty** — confidence level + key unknowns
- **Invalidation point** — what breaks the entire analysis
- **Human decision primacy** — the skill advises, the human decides

Violation of any constraint → output is invalid → re-evaluate.
